It is calculated as the ratio of users who click on an ad to the number of users who view the ad. A higher CTR indicates more successful engagement with the audience, which can lead to increased conversions and revenue. From time-to-time advertisers experiment with various elements/targeting of an ad to optimise the ROI."
